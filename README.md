This notebook will be a walk-through of an exploratory analysis of the customers for a telecom company. The company is interested in developing a classification model that can predict whether or not a customer will churn. In addition to this model, they are looking for additional insights into how they can optimize their business, to best serve their customers.

This Notebook is accompanied by a tableau dashboard which can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/cole.howson/viz/ColeHowsonCapstoneProject/Dashboard1?publish=yes

The tableau dashboard is meant to be used as a way to surface updated data. The dashboard could be updated frequently, and used to get a overview of some kpi's of the company. The dashboard could be further customized to meet the needs of different departments.
